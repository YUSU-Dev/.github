 # University of York Students' Union (YUSU) Digital Team
 
👋 We’re University of York Students’ Union, and we’re here to represent and support students at the University of York. All students at the University of York are automatically a member of the union, and can take advantage of the services and opportunities we provide such as societies, sports clubs and much more!
 
 We are the digital team and work on developing our [website](https://yusu.org), and digital transfomation. 🖥️
